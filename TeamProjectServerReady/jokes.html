                    A project manager, a computer programmer and a computer operator are driving down the road when the car they are in gets a flat tire. The three men try to solve the problem.<br/><br/>
                    The project manager said: "Let's catch a cab and in ten minutes we'll reach our destination."<br/><br/>

                    The computer programmer said: "We have here the driver's guide. I can easily replace the flat tire and continue our drive."<br/><br/>

                    The computer operator said: "First of all, let's turn off the engine and turn it on again. Maybe it will fix the problem."<br/><br/>

                    Suddenly a Microsoft software engineer passed by and said: "Try to close all windows, get off the car, and then get in and try again."
